                  <p>The resume is your face.</p>
                  <p>In a piece of A4, 210mm * 297mm, a resume ends the previous stage of life and starts the next one.</p>
                  <p>“A nine-storey tower arises from a pile of earth.”(<em>Laozi</em>, chapter 64) Likewise, a pretty-print resume is based on details of font, punctuation, layout and grammar.</p>
                  <p>This guide will systematically explain the essentials of resume writing and typesetting with particular emphasis on typography, helping you make a resume pretty both in form and spirit. For each topic, we will first explain WHAT it is, then WHY it is so, and finally HOW to do it.</p>
                  <p>The guide is trying to be as concise and clear as possible, for different declarations there are four levels of priorities:</p>
                  <ul>
                  <li>MUST, mandatory in typesetting, serious mistake if violated</li>
                  <li>RECOMMEND, conform to general typesetting standards, highly recommended</li>
                  <li>SHOULD NOT, require advanced knowledge or features in typesetting, or diverse in different languages and cultures, or vary with regulations in companies, dangerous to use if not informed</li>
                  <li>MUST NOT, conflict with general typesetting standards, forbidden to apply</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h1 id="font">Font</h1>
                  <p>As text transmits information, the visual feature of the text itself—font—will affect the quality of transmission.</p>
                  <p>In principle, the typesetting of a resume should be concise and clear. As for font, first you should never use fonts that are too fancy, second the types of fonts should not be too many—best limited in three. Here we will discuss some basics of fonts and main points in typesetting.</p>
                  <h2 id="font-classification">Font classification</h2>
                  <h3 id="serif-vs.-sans-serif">Serif vs. sans-serif</h3>
                  <p>In terms of serifs, fonts for Latin alphabet are divided into two families: serif and sans-serif<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
                  <p>A serif is a tiny line attached to the end of a stroke in a letter. A font with serifs is called serif font, or serifed font. In contrast, a font without serifs is called sans-serif font, from the French <em>sans</em>, meaning “without”.</p>

                  <h3 id="proportional-vs.-monospaced">Proportional vs. monospaced</h3>
                  <p>According to whether or not the widths of characters are the same, fonts can be divided into monospaced and proportional. As the name suggests, all letters in a monospaced font occupy the same amount of horizontal space, while in a proportional font they don’t.</p>
                  <figure>
                  <img src="./static/notes/guide/images/1280px-Propvsmono.svg.png" title="image:proportional-and-monospaced-font" alt="Proportional fonts and monospaced fonts" /><figcaption>Proportional fonts and monospaced fonts</figcaption>
                  </figure>
                  <p>In traditional printing, proportional fonts can improve the legibility of words. Due to technical limitations, the early computers and typewriters can not adjust the widths of characters. So all characters are made into the same width, thus monospaced fonts come into being. With the improvement of computer technology, the GUI(graphical user interface) has become the mainstream and been developing continuously; technical limitations no longer exist, so proportional fonts have become quite popular, since they are more naturally legible for human.</p>
                  <h2 id="font-design-and-usage">Font design and usage</h2>
                  <p>Digital Publishing has been developing for many years, and the writing system of English or other similar languages actually has a very small character set, so there are many many kinds of fonts designed by different people with various demands.</p>
                  <p>For a monospaced font, the main focus is on the design of each single letter, other than that, in a proportional font, the space between letters should also be seriously considered.</p>
                  <h3 id="letter-composition">Letter composition</h3>
                  <p>Letters in every font have a consistent structure, font users are supposed to know these basic concepts:</p>
                  <ul>
                  <li>baseline: the invisible line on which “H” or “n” stands</li>
                  <li>cap height: the distance from baseline to the top of a linear uppercase letter like “H” or “E”</li>
                  <li>x-height: the distance from the bottom to the top of lowercase “x”</li>
                  <li>ascender: the ascending parts of lowercase letters like “b”, “d”, “f”, “h”, “k”, “l” over the top of “x” , its height is called the ascender height, the top line which ascenders align is called the ascender line</li>
                  <li>descender: the descending parts of lowercase letters like “g”, “j”, “p”, “q”, “y” below the baseline, its height is called the descender height, the bottom line which descenders align is called the descender line</li>
                  </ul>
                  <figure>

                  <h3 id="letter-spacing">Letter-spacing</h3>
                  <p>Letter-spacing, or tracking, refers to the space between letters. Letter-spacing adjustment is divided into font designers’ side and font users’ side; it affects the density in a line or block of text.</p>
                  <p>For font designers, adjusting the letter-spacing is an important procedure in designing. In a proportional font, the spacing on the left side of a single letter does not necessarily equal that on the right side. The purpose is to ensure readability when the letter is adjacent to whatever other letters on either side.</p>
                  <p>For font users, the letter-spacing adjustment means manually rearranging the space between letters by software after the original typesetting, in order to obtain special alignment<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, or a better layout effect<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
                  <h3 id="kerning">Kerning</h3>
                  <p>Kerning refers to the process of increasing or decreasing the space between specific letter pairs in a proportional font. These pairs are called kerning pairs. Kerning is more concerned about the visual spacing rather than the actual spacing.</p>
                  <p>Designers of many fonts will pay attention to kerning pairs while designing, and store kerning adjustment values in the font file. In this way, typesetting software can automatically adjust spacing for kerning pairs according to the values, thus produce a better layout effect.</p>
                  <p>Every letter has a unique shape, so during the design and implementation of a font, letters in all kerning pairs must cooperate to produce the best visual effect. In fact, this is where the key procedure and difficulties lie<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>
                  <figure>

                  </figure>
                  <h3 id="ligature">Ligature</h3>
                  <p>A ligature is a glyph that joins two or more letters together.</p>
                  <p>Printing ligatures originate from letters combined in handwriting. After the birth of movable-type printing, many ligatures were directly made into type. However, in the 1950s, sans-serif fonts began to be widely used, and in the 1970s phototypesetting was invented, so gradually ligatures were rarely used. The earliest software that could use ligatures for digital typesetting is TeX created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth">Donald Knuth</a>. This trend also affected the typesetting technology on computer desktop after 1985. In early times, software could not replace letters with ligatures(but TeX could), and most of the newly made fonts for computers did not include ligatures. Furthermore, early personal computers mostly displayed English, and ligatures are not necessary for English, so there was no real need. With the development of digital typesetting technology such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenType">OpenType</a>, ligatures have gradually returned to practice<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>
                  <p>In general daily business documents, absence of ligatures will not be treated as spelling error, but for professional typesetting in advertising, book publishing and other fields, ligatures are essentially required.</p>

                  <h3 id="italics">Italics</h3>
                  <p>Italics are fonts in which the letters slant slightly to the right. Italics are based on normal font style, and refer to italic type or oblique type<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>.</p>
                  <p>In italic type, forms of letters are changed compared with the normal type, while in oblique type, letters are merely tilted right without any modification on the forms. Oblique type is simply realized through algorithms by software, as a result, the strokes of letters will appear loose. Recently, more and more designs are inclined to apply newly designed italic type.</p>
                  <p>Theoretically, italics include italic type and oblique type, but it should be noticed that actually not all italic type are slanted .</p>
                  <p>In practice, italics are usually applied to one piece of text to emphasize or distinguish it from the main body that is in serif fonts.</p>
                  <h3 id="combined-font-solution">Combined font solution</h3>
                  <p>There are tons of fonts out there nowadays, so to commend a universal combined font solution for resumes is not so easy as it may seem to be.</p>
                  <ul>
                  <li>RECOMMEND, using serif fonts in the main body</li>
                  <li>RECOMMEND, using sans-serif fonts for titles, but serif fonts can also be used</li>

                  <h1 id="punctuation">Punctuation</h1>
                  <p>Punctuation is the most humble but also most error-prone part in resume writing. Whether or not the usage of punctuation is correct and standardized reflects the attitude of job applicants.</p>
                  <p>To apply correct and standardized punctuation may seem easy, but actually not. The main reason is that there is no definite specification for punctuation usage in different situations, or there are specifications but no clear-cut rules, or there exist multiple sets of style guidelines (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_guide">Style Guide</a>), but they are incompatible or even conflicted with each other. We will attempt to summarize some universal rules for your reference here.</p>
                  <ul>
                  <li>MUST, adding one space after commas, periods, semicolons, colons, exclamation marks and question marks</li>
                  <li>MUST, adding one space before an open bracket and after a closed bracket, same as a word, but no space after a closed bracket followed by a comma</li>
                  <li>RECOMMEND, adding one space between a number and its unit</li>
                  <li>RECOMMEND, not adding spaces around a hyphen, sometimes necessary to fine-tune the letter-spacing</li>
                  <li>RECOMMEND, not adding spaces around a slash which locates two parallel things like “A or B”</li>
                  <li>RECOMMEND, using quotation marks (“ ‘ ”, “ ’ ”, “ “ ”, “ ” ”), instead of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe">apostrophes</a></li>
                  <li>SHOULD NOT, adding any punctuation mark at the end of items in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_(typography)">Bullet list</a></li>
                  <li>MUST NOT, hanging a punctuation mark at the start of a line, which can be avoided by software’s automatic settings or manual adjustment</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h2 id="connective-mark">Connective mark</h2>
                  <p>Hyphen (-), en-dash (–), and em-dash (—) are extremely easy to be confused, thus cause errors in typesetting. The usage of them is described below.</p>
                  <blockquote>
                  <p>for a hyphen, type a hyphen (-);</p>
                  <p>for an en-dash, type two hyphens (--);</p>
                  <p>for an em-dash, type three hyphens (---);</p>
                  <p>for a minus sign, type a hyphen in mathematics mode ($-$).</p>
                  <p>— Donald Knuth, <em>The TeXBook</em></p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <h3 id="hyphen--">Hyphen (-)</h3>
                  <p>The hyphen is used primarily for:</p>
                  <ul>
                  <li>compound words such as “upper-case letter”</li>
                  <li>separating numbers or characters, such as telephone numbers, “1-888-777-666”</li>
                  <li>hyphenating the word at the end of a line to keep the whole layout neat</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>There are a few rules about hyphenation at the end of a line:</p>
                  <ul>
                  <li>trying not to hyphenate the last word in more than three continuous lines</li>
                  <li>avoiding dividing proper nouns, personal names, etc.</li>
                  <li>avoiding cross-page hyphenation</li>
                  <li>segmenting words according to syllables in principle, however the position to hyphenate varies with words, so it’s better to check dictionaries if necessary<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></li>
                  </ul>
                  <h3 id="en-dash">En-dash (–)</h3>
                  <p>The length of an en-dash equals the width of uppercase “N”, and is half of the length of an em-dash. It’s mainly used for:</p>
                  <ul>
                  <li>indicating the spans of numbers, such as dates in a year, “July–August 1968”</li>
                  <li>connecting the start and end of addresses, such as “Boston–Hartford route”</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>When using an en-dash, generally it’s not recommended to add spaces around it.</p>
                  <h3 id="em-dash">Em-dash (—)</h3>
                  <p>The length of an em-dash equals the width of uppercase “M”, and its usage is the most flexible and complex. The em-dash is usually used for:</p>
                  <ul>
                  <li>explaining something in details, equivalent to parentheses or colons</li>
                  <li>segmenting declarative clauses</li>
                  <li>indicating that the conversation is interrupted, in which case an ellipsis may also be used</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>In addition, there are situations where two or three em-dashes are joined together, but not to be detailed here<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a>.</p>
                  <h1 id="layout">Layout</h1>
                  <p>Typesetting is like building a two-dimensional architecture.</p>
                  <p>If the text and its fonts are the materials for construction, then the layout design is the architectural drawing. Before discussing the design of layout, we need to make some of the basic concepts clear, especially the unit system of font size in typography.</p>
                  <h2 id="font-size">Font size</h2>
                  <p>Font size is the standard measure of the characters’ size in text. The international universal unit of font size is the point.</p>
                  <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(typography)">point</a> is usually abbreviated as pt, it’s the smallest unit of measure in typography. In fact, the size of the point has varied throughout the history of printing. Since the 18th century, the point’s size has varied from 0.18 to 0.4 mm. Following the advent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_publishing">desktop publishing</a> in the 1980s and 1990s, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_printing ">digital printing</a> has largely supplanted the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press">letterpress printing</a> and gradually established the DTP point as the facto standard.</p>
                  <p>The DTP point is defined as 1/72 of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inch">inch</a>.</p>
                  <p>Most fonts will make the best effects when set to 10-12 pt. In other words, both the strokes and structure of characters themselves and the spacing between characters will present relatively good visual effects in such size. The larger the font size, the looser the text appears, so you need to manually decrease the character spacing; on the other hand, the smaller the font size, the more compact the text appears, so you need to manually increase the character spacing.</p>

                  <h2 id="leading">Leading</h2>
                  <p>Leading or line-spacing refers to the distance between the baselines of two consecutive lines.</p>

                  </figure>
                  <p>The ideal leading is at least 120% of the text’s font size, generally 1.2-1.5 times are recommended. Different fonts have different x-height, in principle, the larger the x-height of the font applied, the larger the leading should be, conversely, the smaller the x-height, the smaller the leading.</p>
                  <h2 id="page-layout">Page layout</h2>
                  <p>Layout is the outline of typesetting, it’s like the head-rope of a fishing net, once the head-rope is raised up, all the meshes spread naturally. In addition to general typesetting rules for font size and leading, there are some unique requirements in resume layout design. In principle, it’s best to control the resume in one page.</p>
                  <ul>
                  <li>Making the language clear and concise</li>
                  <li>Adjusting the font size and leading within a reasonable range</li>
                  <li>Keeping page margins in 10-25 mm and making the left and right margins symmetrical</li>
                  <li>Using lists rather than parallel sentences to list information</li>
                  <li>Using flush left alignment, taking caution to use justified alignment
                  <ul>
                  <li>Justified alignment may cause problems in hyphenation and letter-spacing because the lengths of words are different</li>
                  </ul></li>

                  <h2 id="content">Content</h2>
                  <p>Conciseness is the most important for a resume, and the core contents consist of basic and objective information:</p>
                  <ul>
                  <li>personal information
                  <ul>
                  <li>important contact information such as telephone, e-mail must be clear</li>
                  </ul></li>
                  <li>education backgrounds
                  <ul>
                  <li>if you are a fresh graduate, you can add education background of high school</li>
                  </ul></li>
                  <li>professional skills</li>
                  <li>awards</li>
                  <li>work (internship) experiences</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Be cautious to add subjective information:</p>
                  <ul>
                  <li>self-evaluation</li>
                  <li>personal hobbies</li>
                  <li>social activities, volunteer experiences, etc., which have no clear relations with the applied position</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Be cautious to add objective information that are unrelated with the applied position:</p>
                  <ul>
                  <li>photos</li>
                  <li>birthday</li>

                  <li>marital and family status</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Prohibited contents:</p>
                  <ul>
                  <li>“My Resume” as the title</li>
                  <li>watermarks of logos on resume templates from different sources</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h2 id="spelling">Spelling</h2>
                  <p>Spelling mistakes in a resume is a big taboo when applying for jobs. Too many primary spelling mistakes will make bad first impressions of applicants on employers. Most software have the spelling check function, using it appropriately can avoid many primary spelling errors. Of course, you can never rely too much on the software’s spelling check, it’s better to find a trusted friend for proof-reading.</p>
                  <h3 id="proper-nouns">Proper nouns</h3>
                  <p>Besides common spelling mistakes, there are highly frequent spelling mistakes in proper nouns, because they are more case sensitive. The same combination of letters with different capitalization may have completely different meanings in various fields, job seekers must be very cautious. For example, <a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/">iOS</a> with lowercase “i” represents the mobile operating system on an Apple iPhone, while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_IOS">IOS</a> with uppercase “I” is the dedicated system on a Cisco router.</p>

                  <h2 id="file-format">File format</h2>
                  <p>Common file formats for resumes include:</p>
                  <ul>
                  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format">PDF</a></li>
                  <li>Microsoft Word (doc, docx)</li>
                  <li>Plain Text</li>
                  <li>HTML</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Here we recommend PDF most:</p>
                  <ul>
                  <li>PDF has quite excellent quality of output across platforms, and can guarantee almost 100% consistent printing and display effects</li>
                  <li>fonts can be embedded in PDF, so it’s quite free to choose fonts</li>
                  <li>on most platforms there is a default PDF reader
                  <ul>
                  <li>Windows 8 and above have a built-in PDF reader</li>
                  <li>Mac OS X has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preview_(Mac_OS)">Preview</a>, iOS has <a href="http://www.apple.com/ibooks/">iBooks</a></li>
                  <li>many browsers (such as Chrome) have built-in <a href="http://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/">pdf.js</a>, which can also open PDF by default</li>
                  </ul></li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>It’s easier to learn MS Word, but delivering a resume with Word format has great disadvantages:</p>
                  <ul>
                  <li>Word documents must be opened with additional office software installed
                  <ul>
                  <li>Microsoft Word, <a href="https://wps.com">WPS Office</a> for Windows</li>
                  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IWork">iWork</a> for Mac OS X</li>
                  <li><a href="https://wps.com">WPS Office</a>, <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a> for Linux</li>
                  <li>many online document editing systems such as <a href="https://docs.google.com/">Google Docs</a> can also open and edit Word documents</li>
                  </ul></li>
                  <li>Word documents may display quite differently in different software on different platforms
                  <ul>
                  <li>in reality not everyone has installed <a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/word">Microsoft Word</a> on his computer</li>
                  <li>another fact is that a genuine license for Microsoft Word will cost hundreds of dollars</li>
                  </ul></li>
                  <li>in order to ensure consistent display and output effects, it’s best to use only a few shared fonts on mainstream operating systems in Word documents, which greatly limits the freedom of fonts selection</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Of course, different HR managers in various companies can have different requirements and preferences. We recommend that you export the resume to PDF as an alternative if making it by Word</p>
                  <h2 id="email-etiquette">Email etiquette</h2>
                  <p>Besides unique recruitment systems of companies, emails are the main approach for candidates to deliver resumes. The basics of email etiquette are as follows:</p>
                  <ul>
                  <li>set up correct mailbox nicknames, do not use informal nicknames that are too fancy, which will make a very unprofessional impression on the employers</li>
                  <li>use a uniform format in the email header, keep it clear and concise to convey the most important information
                  <ul>
                  <li>recommended format: Apply-Company Position-Name-[University/Education]-[Work Experience]</li>
                  </ul></li>
                  <li>keep the email text concise, it’s not recommended to write a too long application letter that is very emotional or contains too much personal subjective evaluation
                  <ul>
                  <li>best to add the title and a greeting at the beginning of text</li>
                  <li>contents in body
                  <ul>
                  <li>basic personal information, such as work status (in-service or not), position, education and work experiences, etc.</li>
                  <li>applying position</li>
                  <li>applying approach, whether recommended by others</li>
                  </ul></li>
                  <li>add an inscriber containing name and contact information (telephone/email)</li>
                  </ul></li>
                  <li>attach the resume file named with the same format of the header</li>
                  </ul>
